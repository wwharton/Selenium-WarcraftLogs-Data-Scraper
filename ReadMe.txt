This scraper captures meta data about World of Warcraft players from the website Warcraft Logs.
It uses Selenium and Beautiful Soup, and I chose to run it with a headless Chrome driver.

The player names to be queried were, in my case, generated by another script which I used to
    accomplish a similar task by calling on the website's API directly (also available in my Github)

Warcraft Logs, regrettably, throttles queries after 30 visits.
I investigated ways to work around this with IP/User Agent, but did not pursue implementation.
